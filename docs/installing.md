Info on how to install luauberry, and luauberry libraries

> [!NOTE]
> luauberry is not avaliable on any package managers, as I'm waiting for luau to get an offical package manager before bothering with any of that.

## Methods

### Releases

For every library theres a release containing a zip file for that library, and an rbxm. Theres also an rbxm and zip file that include dependencies for that library if that library has dependencies, just look for `-deps` at the end of file names.
