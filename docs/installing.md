Info on how to install rbxlibs, and rbxlibs libraries

> [!NOTE]
> rbxlibs is not avaliable on any package managers, as I'm waiting for luau to get an offical package manager before bothering with any of that.

## Methods

### Releases

For every github release after `v1.4.1`, theres zip files for every library that contain a rbxm file if you're using studio, a luau dir if you're using vscode or another code editor, and also a typescript dir for those who use roblox-ts.
Theres also a zip file called `ALL_LIBS` that contains every library, although at the moment this doesn't have a typescript output.

### Copy & Paste

You can also just go to the source on github and just copy files
