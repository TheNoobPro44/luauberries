# Installing

Info on how to install rbxlibs, and rbxlibs libraries

> [!NOTE]
> rbxlibs is not avaliable on any package managers, as I'm waiting for luau to get an offical package manager before bothering with any of that.

## Methods

### Releases

For every github release after `v1.4.1`, theres zip files for every library that contain a rbxm file if you're using studio, and a luau file if you're using vscode or another code editor.
Theres also a zip file called `libs` that contains every library, although at the moment this only contains an rbxm.

### Copy & Paste

You can also just go to the source on github and just copy files
